        <h1>Home</h1>
        <h2>Welcome to The Savvy Method</h2>
        <p>Anxiety can feel overwhelming, unpredictable, and uncontrollable. But it does not have to define who you are.
            The Savvy Method is a space designed to help you understand anxiety, recognize the patterns that keep it
            repeating, and learn realistic ways to respond to anxious thoughts with clarity and compassion.</p>
        <p>This website focuses on the idea that anxiety is not an identity, but a temporary experience. Through some
            education, reflection, and consistent thought work, you'll learn how anxiety is formed, why it tends to
            repeat itself, and how small intentional changes can begin to break those cycles. Each section of the site
            builds on the last, guiding you from understanding anxiety to actively working with it in a grounded and
            realistic way.</p>
        <p>You'll find tools for separating facts from feelings, rewriting unhelpful thought patterns, practicing
            visualization, and cultivating gratitude. Not as quick fixes, but as skills that grow with time and
            consistency. Each page also includes a reflection or practice section to help you apply what you've learned
            in a way that feels manageable long-term.</p>
        <p>You don't need to have everything figured out to be here. The purpose of this site is to remind you that
            growth happens in small steps, and that change is possible even when anxiety tells you otherwise.</p>

        <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Simple explanations for why anxiety repeats itself</li>
            <li>Tools for breaking anxious cycles through small intentional changes</li>
            <li>A method for separating facts from feelings</li>
            <li>Ways to rewrite unhelpful thought patterns into realistic, empowering ones</li>
            <li>Practices like visualization and gratitude to support emotional resilience</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>A Small Note of Encouragement</h2>
        <p>If you're here, it means you're trying. And that matters more than you may realize. Anxiety has a way of
            convincing us that we're stuck, broken, or alone in our experience, but none of those things are true. You
            are not weak for feeling anxious, and you are not failing because you haven't "fixed" it yet.</p>
        <p>Take a moment to acknowledge yourself for showing up. Even reading, reflecting, or being curious about change
            is a meaningful step forward. You don't have to rush the process or compare your journey to anyone else's.
            Progress looks different for everyone, and it often starts small.</p>
        <p>As you move through this site, remind yourself that anxiety is something you experience temporarily. It isn't
            who you are. Have some grace for yourself, stay open to learning and going through trial and error, and
            trust that with time, patience, and practice, new patterns and a new life can form. You are capable of
            growth, and you are far more resilient than anxiety allows you to see. </p>
